Dataset Introduction:
The dataset, `annual_aqi_by_county_2018-2023.csv`, provides a comprehensive overview of the annual Air Quality Index (AQI) across various counties in the United States from 2018 to 2023. AQI is a metric used to gauge air quality, and it integrates multiple pollutants into a single, easy-to-understand value. The data reveals patterns and trends in air quality across regions over time, offering valuable insights for environmental analysis and policy formulation. By understanding this information, stakeholders can identify pollution sources, assess public health impacts, and develop strategies to improve air quality.
